A basic django-graphQL implementation.

I have included an image of the graphQL GUI output. 

The corresponding url is the http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql, but this may differ on another machine. 

It should be possible to use a front end language to pull this graphQL data as JSON. There is currently
only one entry in the array, a dummy entry for testing purposes.
