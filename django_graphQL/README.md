<h1>A basic django-graphQL implementation.<h1>

I have included an image of the graphQL GUI output. 
  
![graphql](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71881578/122918044-9aa3b400-d356-11eb-8f32-839845cd86c8.PNG)

The corresponding url is the http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql, but this may differ on another machine. 

It should be possible to use a front end language to pull this graphQL data as JSON. There is currently
only one entry in the array, a dummy entry for testing purposes.
